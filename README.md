# Solana NFT Scam Detection AI System

## Overview

### Problem
NFT scams are prevalent on the **Solana blockchain**, with malicious actors using **deceptive metadata, fake domains, and phishing tactics** to trick users. Identifying fraudulent NFTs in real time is challenging, as manual verification is time-consuming and unreliable.

### Our Project & Solution
This AI-powered system detects scam NFTs by analyzing their **metadata** and associated **domain (website)**. It integrates an **SGDClassifier-based machine learning model** with blockchain data from **Solana RPC** to provide a **real-time scam risk score**. 

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Scam Detection**: Instantly evaluates NFTs to alert users of potential fraud.
- **Multi-Layered Analysis**: Assesses metadata, domain legitimacy, and other risk factors.
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Designed for easy integration and expansion across NFT marketplaces.

By leveraging **AI and Solana RPC**, our system helps users **stay aware of scams** and make informed decisions before engaging with a **Solana NFT**.

## Technology Stack

### **Frontend:**
- **React.js** â€“ For the user interface, allowing users to input an Solana NFT mint address and retrieve scam scores.

### **Backend:**
### Express.js
- Handles API endpoints that:
  - Receive the mint address from the frontend.
  - Fetch NFT details, including metadata, description, and associated domain, from Solana.
  - Pass the retrieved data to the FastAPI backend for further analysis.

### FastAPI
- Processes the NFT details using an **SGDClassifier-based AI model** and rule-based algorithms.
- Analyzes the NFT's metadata and domain details.
- Assigns a scam risk score on the basis of rules and classification done by AI model.
- WHOIS checks are performed separately but contribute to the overall risk assessment.


### **AI and Machine Learning:**
- **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)** â€“ AI model for scam detection based on  NFT Details.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** â€“ Text feature extraction for analyzing NFT descriptions.
- **SGD Classifier** â€“ A machine learning model trained to detect scam patterns.
- **Joblib** â€“ Model serialization for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Installation & Setup

### **1. Clone the Repository:**
```sh
 git clone <repository_url>
 cd <project_directory>
```

### **2. Install Dependencies:**
#### **For Frontend (React.js)**
```sh
 cd client
 npm install
 npm start
```

#### **For Backend Express.js**
```sh
 cd backend/express-api
 npm install  # For Express.js API
```

#### **For Backend FastAPI**
```sh
 cd backend/fastapi-api
 python -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
 pip install -r requirements.txt  # For FastAPI & AI model
```


### **3. Run the Services:**
#### **Start Express.js API:**
```sh
# Start the Express.js server with Nodemon (for hot-reloading)
npx nodemon --ext ts src/server.ts
```
#### **Start FastAPI Server:**
```sh
# Start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## How It Works
1. **User inputs an NFT mint address** â†’ React frontend sends a request to Express.js API.
2. **Express.js API fetches NFT metadata** from Solana via Web3.js.
3. **Metadata is processed by AI model** â†’ Scam score is predicted using a trained SGD classifier.
4. **Scam score is returned to the user** â†’ Displayed in a simple UI as a score out of 100.

## Example Code Snippets

### **Python AI Model**
```python
import re
import joblib
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the trained model and vectorizer
model = joblib.load("solana_nft_scam_model.pkl")
vectorizer = joblib.load("solana_vectorizer.pkl")

 # ðŸ”¹ Step 2: ML Model Prediction
X_test_tfidf = vectorizer.transform([description])  # Vectorize input
prediction = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)[0]  # Get model prediction (1 = Scam, 0 = Not Scam)

if prediction == 1:
    print("scam")
        score_data["score"] += 25  # âœ… Boost score if ML model flags it as a scam
    else:
        print("No scam")

```

### **Solana Metadata Fetching (JavaScript)**
```Typescript
export async function getNFTMetadata(mintAddress: string) {
  // Initialize the connection to the Solana cluster
  
  try{

  
  const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com", "confirmed");



  // Initialize Metaplex with the connection
  const metaplex = new Metaplex(connection);

  // Convert the mint address to a PublicKey
  const mint = new PublicKey(mintAddress);

  // Fetch the NFT metadata
  const nft = await metaplex.nfts().findByMint({ mintAddress: mint });


  // Log the NFT metadata
  const nftData = ({
    name: nft.name,  // âœ… NFT project name (Correct)
    symbol: nft.symbol,  // âœ… Token symbol (Correct)
    description: nft.json?.description,  // âœ… NFT description (Correct)
    image: nft.json?.image,  // âœ… Image URL (Correct)
    external_url: nft.json?.external_url,  // âœ… Project's external URL (Correct)
    seller_fee_basis_points: nft.sellerFeeBasisPoints,  // âœ… Royalties percentage (Correct)
    creators: nft.creators?.map(creator => creator.address.toBase58()),  // âœ… Creator addresses (Correct)
    update_authority: nft.updateAuthorityAddress.toBase58(),  // âœ… Who controls updates? (Correct)
    mint_address: nft.address.toBase58(),  // âœ… Mint address (Fixed Error: nft.address instead of nft.mintAddress)
    metadata_uri: nft.uri,  // âœ… Metadata URI (Correct)
});

   return nftData;

  }catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching NFT metadata:", error);
    return null;
}

}
```

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Availability**: Initially, obtaining high-quality datasets of scam and legitimate URLs was difficult.  
  - **Solution**: Integrated **WHOIS API** to analyze NFT domain legitimacy and leveraged **SGDClassifier** for scam classification after facing issues with earlier models like LightGBM. This helped improve scam detection accuracy.  

- **Model Accuracy**: Early attempts at URL classification lacked reliability due to insufficient training data.  
  - **Solution**: Transitioned to **SGDClassifier**, which performed better with limited data, and continuously refined the dataset for improved results.  

- **Blockchain Data Retrieval**: While NFT metadata was relatively easy to fetch, ensuring efficient and fast processing was crucial.  
  - **Solution**: Designed a well-structured **backend architecture** using **Express.js** and **FastAPI**, ensuring seamless communication between services. By structuring the API workflow efficiently, I built a scalable system that can function as a standalone API for broader integration.  

As the dataset grows, the system will become even more robust, making NFT Scam detection **more precise and scalable**. ðŸš€
