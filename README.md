## AI Model Overview: Solana NFT Scam Detection (MVP) 

This project utilizes a **hybrid approach** combining **heuristic rules** and **machine learning (ML)** to detect potential NFT scams on the Solana blockchain.  

## ðŸ”¹ AI Model  
- **Algorithm:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier  
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)  
- **Training Data:** 100 labeled samples (50 scams, 50 legitimate) - Small dataset, further refinement planned.  
- **Training Framework:** Scikit-learn  

## ðŸ”¹ Heuristic-Based Detection  
The system also applies **rule-based scoring** to assess suspicious patterns, such as:  
- ðŸš© **Domain Analysis** (e.g., `.xyz`, `.top`, keywords like "giveaway")  
- ðŸš© **Project Description Analysis** (e.g., "risk-free", "double your money")  

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works  
1. **Heuristic Analysis:** Assigns a risk score based on predefined scam patterns.  
2. **ML Classification:** The trained **SGDClassifier** predicts if a project is fraudulent.  
3. **Final Score:** A combined score determines the scam likelihood.  

---

## How It Works (MVP)
1. **User inputs an NFT mint address** â†’ React frontend sends a request to Express.js API.
2. **Express.js API fetches NFT Details** from Solana via Web3.js. and sends to Fast API(Contains AI Model)
3. **NFT Details is processed by AI model** â†’ Scam score is predicted using a trained SGD classifier and other rule based algorithms.
4. **Scam score is returned to the user** â†’ Displayed in a simple UI as a score out of 100.

## Example Code Snippets

### **Python AI Model**
```python
import re
import joblib
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the trained model and vectorizer
model = joblib.load("solana_nft_scam_model.pkl")
vectorizer = joblib.load("solana_vectorizer.pkl")

 # ðŸ”¹ Step 2: ML Model Prediction
X_test_tfidf = vectorizer.transform([description])  # Vectorize input
prediction = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)[0]  # Get model prediction (1 = Scam, 0 = Not Scam)

if prediction == 1:
    print("scam")
        score_data["score"] += 25  # âœ… Boost score if ML model flags it as a scam
    else:
        print("No scam")

```

### **Solana Metadata Fetching (TypeScript)**
```Typescript
export async function getNFTMetadata(mintAddress: string) {
  // Initialize the connection to the Solana cluster
  
  try{

  
  const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com", "confirmed");



  // Initialize Metaplex with the connection
  const metaplex = new Metaplex(connection);

  // Convert the mint address to a PublicKey
  const mint = new PublicKey(mintAddress);

  // Fetch the NFT metadata
  const nft = await metaplex.nfts().findByMint({ mintAddress: mint });


  // Log the NFT metadata
  const nftData = ({
    name: nft.name,  // âœ… NFT project name (Correct)
    symbol: nft.symbol,  // âœ… Token symbol (Correct)
    description: nft.json?.description,  // âœ… NFT description (Correct)
    image: nft.json?.image,  // âœ… Image URL (Correct)
    external_url: nft.json?.external_url,  // âœ… Project's external URL (Correct)
    seller_fee_basis_points: nft.sellerFeeBasisPoints,  // âœ… Royalties percentage (Correct)
    creators: nft.creators?.map(creator => creator.address.toBase58()),  // âœ… Creator addresses (Correct)
    update_authority: nft.updateAuthorityAddress.toBase58(),  // âœ… Who controls updates? (Correct)
    mint_address: nft.address.toBase58(),  // âœ… Mint address (Fixed Error: nft.address instead of nft.mintAddress)
    metadata_uri: nft.uri,  // âœ… Metadata URI (Correct)
});

   return nftData;

  }catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching NFT metadata:", error);
    return null;
}

}
```

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Availability**: Initially, obtaining high-quality datasets of scam and legitimate URLs was difficult.  
  - **Solution**: Integrated **Rule Based** to analyze NFT domain legitimacy and leveraged **SGDClassifier** for scam classification after facing issues with earlier models like LightGBM. This helped improve scam detection accuracy. And bring up MVP Faster.

- **Model Accuracy**: Early attempts at URL classification lacked reliability due to insufficient training data.  
  - **Solution**: Transitioned to **SGDClassifier**, which performed better with limited data, and continuously refined the dataset for improved results.  

- **Blockchain Data Retrieval**: While NFT metadata was relatively easy to fetch, ensuring efficient and fast processing was crucial.  
  - **Solution**: Designed a well-structured **backend architecture** using **Express.js** and **FastAPI**, ensuring seamless communication between services. By structuring the API workflow efficiently, I built a scalable system that can function as a standalone API for broader integration.  

As the dataset grows, the system will become even more robust, making Solana NFT Scam detection **more precise and scalable**. ðŸš€
